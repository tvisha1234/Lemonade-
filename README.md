Lemonade is a very popular drink that refreshes the mind and calms you down.

Lemonade is very easy to make, does not take much time to put together, and helps you cool down after a busy day.

To prepare lemonade, you will need the following: 

1) lemons : 2 to 3

2) water : 2 to 3 glasses

3) sugar : 2 to 3 spoons

4) salt : as per taste

5) cardomom (optional) : 4 to 5 seeds

Steps:

1) Add water in a jug or glass, depending on how much you want to prepare.

2) Squeeze the lemons into the glass/jug. 

3) Add sugar to the mix. You can add more if you want it to be sweeter.

4) Add salt as per your taste. Usually about 1 teaspoon is enough.

5) If you have cardomom, remove the skin and crush it. 

6) Add about 4 to 5 seeds. This enhances the smell and flavor of the drink.
