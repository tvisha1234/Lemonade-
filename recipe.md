Steps:

1) Add water in a jug or glass, depending on how much you want to prepare.

2) Squeeze the lemons into the glass/jug. 

3) Add sugar to the mix. You can add more if you want it to be sweeter.

4) Add salt as per your taste. Usually about 1 teaspoon is enough.

5) If you have cardomom, remove the skin and crush it. 

6) Add about 4 to 5 seeds. This enhances the smell and flavor of the drink.
